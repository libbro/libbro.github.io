Hello, my name is **[REDACTED]** and I am the usual run of the mill guywithablog. I like to ramble about topics that I have a superficial understanding of and state my opinion as if it were that of an expert. This makes my blog the ideal source for information. If you truly want to know more about me, you can find snippets of information about me in my *PENDING* blog posts.
